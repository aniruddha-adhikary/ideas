# Ani's Whacky Ideas, for take
A collection of ideas I get from time to time, preserving before I forget them or not find them interesting!

Please feel free to take these ideas, and build something.
> If you do, please consider 🌏 [opening an issue](https://github.com/aniruddha-adhikary/ideas/issues/new?labels=built+something) and letting me know! I will list your implementation here.

## Finance

- 🏦 **Exchange Rate Aggregator**: This would aggregate exchange rates from across the internet, and allow users to find the cheapest money-exchange options for buying Foreign Currency. (Yes these already exist but not good enough for ASEAN and South Asia)
- 💳 **Live Budgeting App**: The spending tracker would be live. So for Singaporean Banks, as soon as a transaction is made, the entry gets into the budgeting app. So you have idea of your money flow across banks and credit card providers.
- 💸 **Money Spending Behaviour App**: Looking at all your transactions real-time, it would try to deter you from spending money. Like "you could've bought a weeks breakfast instead of that toy you'll never use." Probably LLMs to figure out what items are important for what persona of people to make sure we tune our substitute items.

## Language and Input

- ⌨️ **Bengali Cloud IM**: Like [Sogou Pinyin](https://shurufa.sogou.com), an IM, cloud-synced and ever-evolving, learning from and predicting text for users.
- 🧠 **Bengali PaddleOCR Model**: A general, improved PaddleOCR model for reading Bengali text. Training loops could be powered using augmentation and existing cloud OCRs (i.e, GCloud)?
- ☁️ **PaddleOCR KIE WebUI**: An open source Web-UI for training KIE / Key-value extraction models for [PaddleOCR](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR).

## System Utilities

- ⚙️ **MiFi Battery Indicator**: Display a Menu Bar Icon that displays the battery level on your Portable Router / MiFi device. Ideally could be done for TP-Link. They have a MiFi app so definitely has a nice API to consume. 

## Oddly-specific Open Source Contributions

### Automation

- ✂️ **OpenAPI/Swagger for n8n**: Easily integrate APIs with Swagger specs available with n8n workflow. Either a OpenAPI node... or a CLI tool to convert OpenAPI specifications into n8n community nodes.
