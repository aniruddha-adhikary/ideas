# ideas
A collection of ideas I get from time to time, preserving before I forget them or not find them interesting!

Please feel free to take these ideas, and build something.
> If you do, please consider 🌏 [opening an issue](https://github.com/aniruddha-adhikary/ideas/issues/new?labels=built+something) and letting me know! I will list your implementation here.

## Finance

- 🏦 **Exchange Rate Aggregator**: This would aggregate exchange rates from across the internet, and allow users to find the cheapest money-exchange options for buying Foreign Currency.

## Language and Input

- ⌨️ **Bengali Cloud IM**: Like [Sogou Pinyin](https://shurufa.sogou.com), an IM, cloud-synced and ever-evolving, learning from and predicting text for users.
- 🧠 **Bengali PaddleOCR Model**: A general, improved PaddleOCR model for reading Bengali text. Training loops could be powered using augmentation and existing cloud OCRs (i.e, GCloud)?
- ☁️ **PaddleOCR KIE WebUI**: An open source Web-UI for training KIE / Key-value extraction models for [PaddleOCR](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR).

## System Utilities

- ⚙️ **MiFi Battery Indicator**: Display a Menu Bar Icon that displays the battery level on your Portable Router / MiFi device. Ideally could be done for TP-Link. They have a MiFi app so definitely has a nice API to consume.
