# ideas
A collection of ideas I get from time to time, preserving before I forget them or not find them interesting!

## Language and Input

- **Bengali Cloud IM**: Like [Sogou Pinyin](https://shurufa.sogou.com), an IM, cloud-synced and ever-evolving, learning from and predicting text for users.

## System Utilities

- **MiFi Battery Indicator**: Display a Menu Bar Icon that displays the battery level on your Portable Router / MiFi device. Ideally could be done for TP-Link. They have a MiFi app so definitely has a nice API to consume.
